# Key Vault Security Remediation Summary

## Security Issue Identified
- **Critical Finding**: Key Vault `kv-t5cl7dldgq4` was deployed with public network access enabled
- **Risk**: Potential unauthorized access from the internet despite RBAC controls
- **Expected**: Private endpoint configuration with no public access

## Security Remediation Completed

### Actions Taken
1. **Created Security Update Template**: `secure-keyvault-update.bicep`
   - Disables public network access (`publicNetworkAccess: "Disabled"`)
   - Configures network ACLs with default deny policy
   - Creates private endpoint in the private endpoint subnet
   - Sets up private DNS zone integration for name resolution

2. **Deployed Security Updates**:
   - Key Vault: Updated to disable public access and enable network ACLs
   - Private Endpoint: `pep-kv-platform-ops-dev-centralus` (IP: 10.2.0.69)
   - Private DNS Zone: `privatelink.vault.azure.net` with VNet link
   - DNS Zone Group: Automatic DNS configuration for the private endpoint

### Current Secure Configuration

#### Key Vault Security Settings
```json
{
  "PublicNetworkAccess": "Disabled",
  "NetworkAcls": {
    "bypass": "AzureServices",
    "defaultAction": "Deny",
    "ipRules": [],
    "virtualNetworkRules": []
  }
}
```

#### Private Endpoint Configuration
- **Name**: `pep-kv-platform-ops-dev-centralus`
- **Status**: `Succeeded` and `Approved`
- **Private IP**: `10.2.0.69` (in spoke VNet private endpoint subnet)
- **FQDN**: `kv-t5cl7dldgq4.vault.azure.net`

### Security Verification
✅ **Public Access Blocked**: CLI commands from public internet now receive "Forbidden" error  
✅ **Private Endpoint Active**: Connection state shows "Approved" and "Succeeded"  
✅ **DNS Resolution**: Private DNS zone resolves to private IP (10.2.0.69)  
✅ **Network Isolation**: Only resources in the VNet can access the Key Vault  

### Access Patterns
- **✅ Allowed**: Resources in the hub/spoke VNets (VM, SQL Database, etc.)
- **❌ Blocked**: Direct internet access, public CLI commands from external networks
- **✅ Allowed**: Azure trusted services (when needed for Azure integrations)

### Files Created/Updated
- `secure-keyvault-update.bicep` - Security remediation template
- `parameters/secure-keyvault-update.parameters.dev.json` - Deployment parameters
- Resource group: `rg-platform-ops-dev-cen` (corrected name)

## Recommendations

### Immediate
- **Testing**: Verify VM and SQL Database can still access Key Vault secrets
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for any Key Vault access failures
- **Documentation**: Update architecture diagrams to show private endpoint flow

### Future Deployments
- **Update Bootstrap Template**: Modify `foundations-core.bicep` to include private endpoint by default
- **Policy Enforcement**: Consider Azure Policy to prevent public Key Vault creation
- **Network Security**: Review other resources for similar public access vulnerabilities

### Next Steps
1. Test application connectivity to ensure services can reach Key Vault
2. Update main deployment templates to use secure bootstrap pattern
3. Consider implementing similar private endpoint patterns for other PaaS services

## Architecture Impact
The hub-spoke network now properly isolates the Key Vault:
```
Hub VNet (10.1.0.0/24)
└── Connects to Spoke VNet via peering

Spoke VNet (10.2.0.0/24)
├── Private Endpoint Subnet (snet-pep-*)
│   └── Key Vault Private Endpoint (10.2.0.69)
├── VM Subnet
│   └── Can access KV via private endpoint
└── SQL Database
    └── Can access KV via private endpoint

External Access: ❌ BLOCKED
```

**Security Status**: 🔒 **SECURED** - Key Vault now follows zero-trust network principles
